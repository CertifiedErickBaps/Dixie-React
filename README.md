# Dexie ToDo Example

This project was designed with React-Native

## Install dependencies

Before you can run the app in your browser, you will have to install its dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `sudo npm start` (in case of linux) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.
